# Happy Birthday Animation

This project is a fun, interactive birthday animation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features animated balloons, confetti, fireworks, and a "Happy Birthday!" message that appears letter by letter in a handwriting style.

## Features

- **Animated Balloons:** Balloons float up the screen with a gentle sway. Click near any balloon to pop it!
- **Balloon Pop & Confetti:** When a balloon pops, it bursts into confetti matching its gradient colors.
- **Fireworks:** Click anywhere else on the scene to launch fireworks, complete with confetti bursts.
- **Handwritten Birthday Message:** "Happy Birthday!" is displayed in the center, with each letter animated in sequence.
- **Score & Timer:** Pop balloons to earn points. A timer and scoreboard appear during the game.
- **Responsive Design:** The scene adapts to your browser window size.

## How to Use

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. Watch the balloons float and the birthday message animate.
3. Click on or near balloons to pop them and earn points.
4. Click elsewhere to launch fireworks.
5. Try to pop as many balloons as possible before the timer runs out!

## File Structure
